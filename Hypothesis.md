## When do we want to use a Hypothesis test?
 - We use a hypothesis test when we want to make a claim about an entire population form a sample. 

## 1.) Make Claim
 - For example if we want to measure a drug to see if it has an effect on blood pressure our claim would be: Our drug has an effect on blood pressure.

## 2.) Population and Sample
 - Because we want to test if the drug has an effect on blood pressure our population will be all people with high blood pressure. 
 - Its extremely unrealistic to try the drug on everyone in the world with high blood pressure so we will get a sample of people instead.   

## 3.) Hypothesis Test
 - Now we are going to test the claim from step 1 using data in our sample. 
 - First to test our claim we will need to establish our assumptions in hypothesis testing we have 2 assumptions: 

**Null hypotheses: H0:**

 - The null hypothesis is what we hold to be true in this case what we hold to be true is the drug has no effect on blood pressure.  

**alternative hypothesis: Ha:**  

 - When we do a hypothesis test our alternative hypothesis is what we are trying to prove so in this case we want to prove that the drug has an effect on blood pressure. 

## 4.) Find p value
**What is a p-value**
 - A p value is a number between 0 and 1 that tells us how likely we are to get a sample that deviates from the null hypothesis or one that deviates more by random chance. 
 - Low p value means that if the null hypothesis is true then we are likely to get a result like the one we saw or one that deviates even more.
 - A low p-value suggests strong evidence against the null hypothesis. 

**How to find a p-value**

 - There are multiple ways to find the p-value, and the method depends on the type of data and the test we are performing:
 - Z-test: Used for large samples with known population variance.
 - T-test: Used for small samples or when the population variance is unknown.
 - Chi-square test: Used for categorical data to test independence or goodness-of-fit.
 - ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): Used to compare means across multiple groups.
 - Ensure the test you choose aligns with your data type and research question.


## 5 significance
 - If our p value is less than our predetermined threshold then the result is considered significant. 
 - Low p value means that the result was not generated by random chance. 
 - If we have a low enough p value then we can reject the null.

| \( P > 0.10 \)          | Weak evidence; data supports \(H_0\).         | Do not reject \(H_0\).             | No strong proof against \(H_0\).      |
| \( 0.05 < P <= 0.10 \)| Some evidence against \(H_0\).                | Usually do not reject \(H_0\).     | Data is unclear; more info needed.    |
| \( 0.01 < P <= 0.05 \)| Strong evidence against \(H_0\).              | Reject \(H_0\).                    | Likely proof for \(H_a\).             |
| \( P <= 0.01 \)       | Very strong evidence against \(H_0\).         | Reject \(H_0\).                    | Very likely proof for \(H_a\).        |


## 6 error 
 **Type I Error:**
 - Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. This is also called a 'false positive.' - or we can have a sample that is so close to the mean even if the null is true.
 
 **Type II Error:**
 - Failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false. This is also called a 'false negative.'
